Human Control is the interactive play layer of MOSAIC's keyboard input,
mouse interaction, and the render view that displays environment state in
real time.  Together these subsystems let a human player step into any
supported environment and interact with it through the GUI.

Input Modes
-----------

The **Input Mode** selector in the Game Configuration panel determines how
MOSAIC translates physical key presses into environment actions.  Two modes
are available, each targeting a different class of environment.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 40 35
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Mode
     - Behaviour
     - Recommended For
   * - | **Shortcut-Based** 
       |  **(Immediate)**

     - Each key press triggers a single, immediate action via Qt
       ``QShortcut`` objects.  No key-state tracking is performed; pressing
       two keys simultaneously dispatches whichever event Qt delivers first.
     - Turn-based and step-by-step environments: FrozenLake, MiniGrid,
       Chess, MiniHack, Jumanji puzzles, BabaIsAI.
   * - **State-Based (Real-time)**
     - A ``keyPressEvent`` / ``keyReleaseEvent`` event filter tracks all
       currently held keys in a set.  On each tick a
       ``KeyCombinationResolver`` inspects the set and produces a combined
       action (e.g., Up + Right = diagonal movement).  Supports WASD and
       arrow keys interchangeably.
     - Real-time and arcade-style environments: Procgen, Atari/ALE,
       ViZDoom, Box2D (LunarLander, CarRacing), MeltingPot.

.. note::

   Multi-agent environments with per-keyboard routing (via Linux ``evdev``)
   **require** state-based mode.  Shortcut-based mode uses Qt's global
   shortcut system, which cannot distinguish between physical keyboards.
   MOSAIC automatically enforces this constraint when a multi-agent
   control mode is selected.

See :doc:`keyboard_input` for the full technical reference, including
per-family key combination resolvers and shortcut mapping tables.

Subsystems
----------

**Keyboard Input:** Per-environment key mappings covering all 26 environment
families, and multi-keyboard support for multi-agent play via Linux ``evdev``.
See :doc:`keyboard_input` for the full reference.

**Render View:** A strategy-pattern rendering pipeline that converts environment
observations into visual output.  Three built-in strategies cover grid
tile maps, RGB pixel arrays, and interactive board games.  See
:doc:`render_view` for the full reference.

Control Modes
-------------

The ``ControlMode`` enum determines who provides actions for each agent.
Human input is active in every mode except ``AGENT_ONLY``.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Control Mode
     - Description
   * - ``HUMAN_ONLY``
     - All actions come from the human keyboard.  No AI agent is involved.
   * - ``AGENT_ONLY``
     - All actions come from an AI agent.  The keyboard is disabled.
   * - ``MULTI_AGENT_COOP``
     - Multiple human players cooperate, each with a dedicated USB keyboard.
   * - ``MULTI_AGENT_COMPETITIVE``
     - Multiple human players compete against each other, each with a
       dedicated USB keyboard.
