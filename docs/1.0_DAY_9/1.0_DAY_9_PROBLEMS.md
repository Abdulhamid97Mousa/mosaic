## Day 9 – Telemetry Routing Problem (Resolved)

### Root Cause
We discovered that two separate `var/` trees were drifting apart:
- **Top-level `var/`** – used by the SPADE worker stack (`spadeBDI_RL_refactored`) for policies and configs.
- **Package-level `gym_gui/var/`** – referenced by the GUI via `gym_gui/config/paths.py`.

Because `paths.py` anchored `VAR_ROOT` to the package directory (`_PACKAGE_ROOT / "var"`), the GUI continued to read/write telemetry under `gym_gui/var/…`, while the worker persisted policies under `<repo>/var/…`. This split explains why live tabs never saw updates even though the daemon was ingesting telemetry—the GUI and daemon referenced different SQLite files.

### Fix
`gym_gui/config/paths.py` now resolves `VAR_ROOT` to the repository-level `var/`:
```python
_PACKAGE_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
_REPO_ROOT = _PACKAGE_ROOT.parent
VAR_ROOT = (_REPO_ROOT / "var").resolve()
```
`ensure_var_directories()` still creates the standard subfolders, but they now live alongside the SPADE artifacts, giving both daemon and GUI a single shared telemetry store (`var/telemetry/telemetry.sqlite`) and trainer database (`var/trainer/trainer.sqlite`).

### Verification Checklist
- [x] Launch `./run.sh` → daemon and GUI agree on `VAR_ROOT`.
- [x] Submit a training run from the GUI → live telemetry populates `Agent-*-Online-Grid` tab.
- [x] Confirm saved policies continue to land in `var/trainer/policies/…`.
- [ ] (Optional) Clean up legacy data under `gym_gui/var/` after backing up any diagnostics.

### Next Steps
1. Add a regression test ensuring `VAR_ROOT` resolves to the repo-level directory.
2. Update onboarding docs to clarify shared runtime storage and expected cleanup commands.
