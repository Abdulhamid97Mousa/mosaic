"""Unit tests for multi-worker Operator system.

This module tests the updated OperatorConfig and WorkerAssignment dataclasses
that support both single-agent and multi-agent (turn-based) environments.

Architecture Overview:
    - Operator = Workers -> Environment binding
    - Single-agent: 1 Worker -> 1 Environment (e.g., BabyAI, MiniGrid)
    - Multi-agent: N Workers -> 1 Environment (e.g., Chess, Go, Connect Four)

Test Categories:
    1. WorkerAssignment dataclass validation
    2. OperatorConfig single-agent factory method
    3. OperatorConfig multi-agent factory method
    4. OperatorConfig backwards compatibility properties
    5. OperatorConfig with_run_id deep copy behavior
    6. OperatorConfig player management methods

Dependencies:
    - gym_gui.services.operator.OperatorConfig
    - gym_gui.services.operator.WorkerAssignment
