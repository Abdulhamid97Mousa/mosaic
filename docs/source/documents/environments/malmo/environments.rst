Environments Reference
======================

All 13 MalmoEnv missions available in MOSAIC are listed here. Each mission is defined by
an XML file bundled in ``3rd_party/environments/malmo/MalmoEnv/missions/``.

Action Space
------------

All MalmoEnv missions share the same **8-action discrete** action space:

     - ``jump 1``
     - Jump
   * - 7
     - ``attack 1``
     - Attack / break block

Observation Space
-----------------

All missions return an **RGB image** ``(H, W, 3)`` as the observation.  The default
resolution is ``84 × 84`` pixels.  The frame is rendered by Minecraft and streamed over TCP
to the Python agent.

.. note::

   The frame dimensions are controlled by the ``<VideoProducer>`` element in the mission XML.
   You can edit the XML to change the resolution; just remember to re-init the env.

Missions
--------

MalmoEnv-MobChase-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``mobchase_single_agent.xml``
:Objective: Chase and reach a mob (pig/cow) in an open flat arena.
:Reward: Positive reward when the agent reaches within a threshold distance of the mob.
:Termination: Fixed time limit (in Malmo ticks).

**Use case:** Testing pursuit / chasing behaviours.  The mob moves randomly, providing a
moving target.


MalmoEnv-MazeRunner-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``mazerunner.xml``
:Objective: Navigate from the start position to the goal block at the exit of a maze.
:Reward: Positive reward on reaching the goal; small negative step penalty.
:Termination: Time limit or goal reached.

**Use case:** Pathfinding and navigation benchmarks in a structured environment.


MalmoEnv-Vertical-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``vertical.xml``
:Objective: Climb a vertical tower of blocks placed on a platform over a void.
:Reward: Reward proportional to height gained.
:Termination: Agent falls off or time limit expires.

**Use case:** Training agents to climb and jump in 3-D environments.


MalmoEnv-CliffWalking-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``cliffwalking.xml``
:Objective: Walk along the top of a cliff from start to goal without falling.
:Reward: +1 for each step toward the goal; large negative reward for falling.
:Termination: Agent falls or reaches the goal.

**Use case:** Safety-aware navigation; dense reward signal for curriculum learning.


MalmoEnv-CatchTheMob-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``catchthemob.xml``
:Objective: Catch a mob that is enclosed in a small arena.
:Reward: Reward on contact with the mob.
:Termination: Time limit.

**Use case:** Simpler mob-chasing variant with a confined space; easier exploration problem.


MalmoEnv-FindTheGoal-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``findthegoal.xml``
:Objective: Locate and stand on a gold block hidden somewhere in a large flat world.
:Reward: Large positive reward on reaching the goal block.
:Termination: Time limit.

**Use case:** Sparse-reward exploration.  The agent must search a wide area with no
intermediate guidance.


MalmoEnv-Attic-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``attic.xml``
:Objective: Navigate an indoor "attic" layout (corridors, rooms, furniture).
:Reward: Positive reward on reaching the designated exit.
:Termination: Time limit.

**Use case:** Indoor navigation with obstacles; closer to real-world room layout.


MalmoEnv-DefaultFlatWorld-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``defaultflatworld.xml``
:Objective: Open-ended flat creative world — no specific mission goal.
:Reward: No default reward (extendable via XML).
:Termination: Time limit.

**Use case:** Free exploration, block placement experiments, custom reward shaping.


MalmoEnv-DefaultWorld-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``defaultworld.xml``
:Objective: Open-ended default Minecraft world generation (survival-style terrain).
:Reward: No default reward.
:Termination: Time limit.

**Use case:** Exploration in a rich procedurally generated landscape; closest to
vanilla Minecraft.


MalmoEnv-Eating-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``eating.xml``
:Objective: Collect food items (bread, carrots, etc.) placed in the world.
:Reward: Positive reward for each food item collected.
:Termination: All items collected or time limit.

**Use case:** Reward-dense item collection for initial policy bootstrapping.


MalmoEnv-Obstacles-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``obstacles.xml``
:Objective: Navigate from start to goal while bypassing a series of obstacles
            (walls, pits, lava).
:Reward: Positive reward on reaching the goal.
:Termination: Agent dies or time limit.

**Use case:** Multi-hazard navigation; tests the agent's ability to plan around traps.


MalmoEnv-TrickyArena-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``trickyarena.xml``
:Objective: Survive in an arena with pits, moving platforms, and hazards.
:Reward: Reward for time survived; penalty for falling into pits.
:Termination: Agent dies or time limit.

**Use case:** Robustness testing — the agent must be reactive to environmental hazards.


MalmoEnv-TreasureHunt-v0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:XML: ``treasurehunt.xml``
:Objective: Find and collect treasure chests scattered across the world.
:Reward: Positive reward for each chest opened.
:Termination: All chests collected or time limit.

**Use case:** Multi-target collection with sparse rewards and exploration requirement.


MarLo Mission History
----------------------

These missions were originally part of the **MarLo** benchmark (the MOSAIC predecessor
used the Go-based ``mosaic_malmo`` package).  They are now served identically through
MalmoEnv by sending the same mission XML files to Minecraft.  The MOSAIC game IDs have
been renamed from ``MosaicMarLo-*-v0`` to ``MalmoEnv-*-v0`` to reflect the new backend.
