"""Regression tests: two random-worker operators must produce independent actions.

Root cause of the bug
---------------------
When the GUI sends ``{"cmd": "reset", "seed": SHARED}`` to synchronise the
starting layout of two operators, ``handle_reset`` was also calling
``self._action_space.seed(seed)`` with that shared value.  This silently
overwrote each worker's unique action-space seed and made both operators
produce the exact same random action sequence — rendering the "two independent
agents" scenario useless.

Fix (``random_worker/runtime.py`` → ``handle_reset``)
------------------------------------------------------
The shared layout seed is now forwarded **only** to ``env.reset(seed=…)`` for
environment reproducibility.  The action-space RNG is seeded exactly once
during ``handle_init_agent`` from ``config.seed`` and is never touched again.

These tests import ``RandomWorkerRuntime`` / ``RandomWorkerConfig`` directly
(no subprocess, no real gymnasium environment) so they run fast and have zero
external dependencies beyond what is already installed in the project venv.
