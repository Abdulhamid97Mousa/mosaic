# Melting Pot Multi-Agent Environment Dependencies
# =============================================================================
# Melting Pot is a suite of multi-agent test scenarios developed by DeepMind
# for evaluating generalization in social multi-agent reinforcement learning.
#
# USAGE:
#   pip install -r requirements/meltingpot.txt
#
# FEATURES:
#   - 50+ multi-agent substrates (game scenarios)
#   - 256+ unique test scenarios
#   - Up to 16 simultaneous agents
#   - Social interaction scenarios: cooperation, competition, deception, trust
#   - Parallel stepping paradigm (all agents act simultaneously)
#   - Compatible with PettingZoo API through Shimmy wrapper
#
# KEY SUBSTRATES:
#   - collaborative_cooking: Cooperative cooking task
#   - prisoners_dilemma: Classic game theory scenario
#   - territory__rooms: Territory control game
#   - clean_up: Public goods game
#   - fruit_market: Trading and resource management
#
# REPOSITORY:
#   https://github.com/google-deepmind/meltingpot
#
# DOCUMENTATION:
#   https://shimmy.farama.org/environments/meltingpot/
#
# NOTES:
#   - Melting Pot does NOT support Windows
#   - Requires Linux or macOS
#   - Uses Shimmy wrapper to convert dm_env to PettingZoo API
#   - Environments are nondeterministic (seeding has limited effect)
