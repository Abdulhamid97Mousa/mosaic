# Writable Runtime Data (`var/`)

This directory tree stores runtime artifacts generated by the Gym GUI while
sessions are running. All contents are safe to delete between runs and are
ignored by version control.

- `records/` – Episode NDJSON dumps, replay snapshots, and other session
  recordings.
- `telemetry/` – The SQLite telemetry store and any derived analytics tables.
- `cache/` – Derived assets and memoized helpers generated on demand.
- `tmp/` – Scratch space for exporters, frame captures, and other transient
  blobs that should not survive application restarts.
- `logs/` – Structured application log files generated by the centralized
  logger configuration.

If you encounter unexpected behavior, you can stop the application and remove
these folders to force a clean restart.
