"""Tests for MultiGrid action mapping fix.

This test verifies that the MultiGridKeyCombinationResolver uses the correct
action indices for MultiGrid environments, fixing the bug where actions were
off-by-1 compared to MiniGrid.

Bug Report: User reported "I used one keyboard, and all agents started to move!"
Root Cause: MiniGrid and MultiGrid use different action indices.

MiniGrid actions:
0: LEFT, 1: RIGHT, 2: FORWARD, 3: PICKUP, 4: DROP, 5: TOGGLE, 6: DONE

MultiGrid actions:
0: STILL, 1: LEFT, 2: RIGHT, 3: FORWARD, 4: PICKUP, 5: DROP, 6: TOGGLE, 7: DONE

The fix creates separate resolvers for MiniGrid and MultiGrid.
