# Learning Journal – Gym GUI

## 2025-10-05 – Phase 0 Scaffold
- Established project skeleton with configuration, enums, and documentation.
- Added `.env` template to practice environment-driven configuration.
- Created typed enums for environment families, control modes, render modes, and agent roles.
- Seeded `gym_gui.app` to verify configuration loading (prints settings, opens a stub Qt window when bindings exist).
- Next: implement the `EnvironmentAdapter` base class and the FrozenLake adapter to validate the abstraction.
