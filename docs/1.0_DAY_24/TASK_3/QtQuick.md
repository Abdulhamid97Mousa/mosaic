# PySide6.QtQuick

https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/PySide6/QtQuick/index.html

Detailed Description
The Qt Quick module implements the “standard library” for QML

The Qt Quick module is the standard library for writing QML applications. While the Qt Qml module provides the QML engine and language infrastructure, the Qt Quick module provides all the basic types necessary for creating user interfaces with QML. It provides a visual canvas and includes types for creating and animating visual components, receiving user input, creating data models and views and delayed object instantiation.

The Qt Quick module provides both a QML API, which supplies QML types for creating user interfaces with the QML language, and a Python API for extending QML applications with Python code.

Note

A set of Qt Quick-based UI controls is also available to create user interfaces. See PySide6.QtQuickControls2 for more information.

If you’re new to QML and Qt Quick, please see QML-Applications for an introduction to writing QML applications.

Using the Module
To include the definitions of modules classes, use the following directive:

import PySide6.QtQuick
Important Concepts in Qt Quick
Qt Quick provides everything you need to create a rich application with a fluid and dynamic user interface. It enables you to build user interfaces around the behavior of user interface components and how they connect with one another, and it provides a visual canvas with its own coordinate system and rendering engine. Animation and transition effects are first class concepts in Qt Quick, and you can add visual effects through specialized components for particle and shader effects.

When using the Qt Quick module, you will need to know how to write QML applications using the QML language. In particular, QML Basics and QML Essentials from the QML Applications page.

To find out more about using the QML language, see Qt Qml.
